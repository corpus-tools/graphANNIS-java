release 0.1.0
=============

Initial development release with an actual release number.

There has been the benchmark-journal-2016-07-27 tag before which was used in a benchmark for a paper.
Since then the following improvements have been made:
- using an edge annotation as base for a node search on the LHS of the join
- adding parallel join implementations

This release is also meant to test the release cycle (e.g. Maven Central deployment) itself.
