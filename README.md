ANNIS4
======

This is a prototype for a new backend implementation of the ANNIS linguistic search and visualization system (http://github.com/korpling/ANNIS/). 
It is part of my ongoing thesis and while there are test cases it is **highly experimental code**!

**Don't use this for real linguistic research!**

There will be a technical report that describes how this prototype works.

How to compile
---------------

ANNIS4 has several dependencies which need to be installed.
Currently ANNIS4 is only tested under the Ubuntu operating system,
but it is planned to add offical support for further operating systems.

1. get the code and change working directory to the source folder: `cd <annis4code>`
2. install CMake build system (at least version XXX): `sudo apt-get install cmake`
3. install dependencies: `sudo apt-get install XXX`
4. create a build-directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
5. build: `cmake ../ && make`
6. optionally run the tests: `./test_ANNIS4`
